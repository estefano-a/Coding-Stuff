We will need this permission before we are able to create an account for you or provide you with any tutoring.\n\nNote to parents of children under the age of 13: You are welcome to call us at (800) 411-1970 to review any identifiable information we have collected about your child. If you desire, you may request that we delete this information and/or specify that we collect no more of your child's information. Please note that we will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian, and that a request for us to delete all personal information about a child requires us to cancel the child's tutoring account.\n\n \n\nWe Share Your Personal Information With Those Who Pay For Your Account and With Those Vendors Who Help Us Process Transactions\n\nIf your parents and/or your school pay for/subsidize any of your tutoring, we may share your Personal Information with them at their request. This may include the content of any (or all) of your tutoring sessions (transcripts) as well as the written comments you leave in post-session surveys. For the purposes of our Privacy Policy, your school is considered to be subsidizing your tutoring if it has negotiated a special price or trial offer for its students. On the other hand, if you pay us for your own account, without the involvement of your parents or your school, we will not share your Personal Information with them.\n\nIf you use a promotion code at 24/7 Education, inc and all websites, (24/7 Education, inc (247teach.org, 247learningcenters.com, 247speak.org, 247learningacademy.com, 247digitalclassrooms.com, 247learningcenters.org and 247speak.com) ) to create an account, or to add minutes to an account, we may let the source of that promotion code know that you used that code. For example, if you sign up for 24/7 Education, inc and all websites, (24/7 Education, inc (247teach.org, 247learningcenters.com, 247speak.org, 247learningacademy.com, 247digitalclassrooms.com, 247learningcenters.org and 247speak.com) ) as part of our tell a friend program, we may let your friend know that you redeemed their tell a friend offer.\n\nWe share your personal information with the vendors (companies) that help us process transactions, such as charging your credit card when you make purchases. Any such sharing is always done subject to a legal agreement that requires them to keep your personal information strictly confidential.\n\nWe May Share Your Personal Information For Safety or Legal Reasons\n\nIf we have reason to believe that disclosing your Personal Identification is required by law, is reasonable to protect someone from possible injury, or as part of a internal or external legal investigation, we may do so.\n\nCookies\n\nCookies are files that your Web browser puts on your computer when you visit a Web site.
