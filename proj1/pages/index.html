    <h1>How the Internet works</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web and Browsers</p>

        such as Chrome, Firefox or Vivaldi.</p2>

    <p>DNS</p>
    <p2>DNS (Domain Name System) is basically the internet's phonebook, as it translates domain names into IP addresses.

    <p>IP Addresses</p>
    <p2>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices on a network, including the internet.
        They are unique to every single device.</p2>

    <p>Protocols</p>
    <p2>Protocols are rules and regulations that control communication between devices and systems on the internet. They
        ensure that data is transmitted, recieved and interpreted correctly.</p2>

    <p>Servers and Clients</p>
    <p2>Servers are robust computing systems designed to store and manage data and information from websites and users.
        Clients are the devices such as smartphones or laptops. </p2>

    <p>Latency and Bandwidth</p>
    <p2>Latency refers to the delay in data transmission over a network, measured in milliseconds. Bandwidth refers to
        the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in a given time.</p2>
