In this CI/CD pipeline, I follow a very simple process.

1. Make a change in VSCode
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Summarize what change I made and then press the commit to main button.
4. Click the push origin button to upload it to GitHub web.

Refelection Question: After completing the project, take a moment too reflect on what you've learned. What did you find challenging? What topics intrigue you the most?

I would say that I found it a little challenging to figure out how to navigate VSCode at first but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.
